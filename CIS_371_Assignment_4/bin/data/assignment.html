<p>Write a simple web server that can serve HTML, plain text, and images.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>

Learn the inner workings of a basic web server to better understand what underlies web platforms. In particular,
students will observe the details of
<ul>
    <li> interpreting an incoming request,</li>
    <li> identifying and finding the requested resource,</li>
    <li> preparing the proper response (which may be an error message), and</li>
    <li> delivering the content (which could be either text or binary data).</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="listHeader">Details</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You may work on this assignment in teams of at most two.</li>
    <li>You may use any language you like. Realize, however, that I will be of limited help if you choose something
        other than Java. (I know C, C++, and Ruby well; but, I don't know much about the particular networking
        libraries.
        I do not know any <code>.net</code> languages. I do not know Windows well.)

    </li>
    <li>You may use standard socket and I/O libraries. You may <em>not</em> use any libraries that implement significant
        web server functionality (e.g., <code>com.sun.net.httpserver</code>).
    </li>
    <li>Cite <em>any</em> sources you consult. Avoid articles that provide complete (or nearly complete) solutions.</li>
    <li>Your web server must be able to serve html, images, and plain text.</li>
    <li>You response headers must include <code>Content-Type</code> and <code>Content-Length</code>. (You may assume the
        content type from the file's extension.)
    </li>
    <li>You must respond correctly to missing and/or unreadable files.</li>
    <li>When run from EOS/Arch, your server must correctly handle the tilde (e.g., "<code>http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/~kurmasz</code>").
    </li>
</ul>

<b>Extra Credit:</b> Have your server support persistent connections (i.e., send all documents in one connection).

<h2 class="listHeader">Hints and Resources</h2>
<ul>
    <li>My solution is 120 lines of Java code. If you find that you need many more lines than this, then you may be
        making the assignment more difficult than necessary.
    </li>
    <li>Use a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html">PrintStream</a> instead of a
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html">PrintWriter</a>. (The <code>PrintStream</code>
        will allow you to write both String and binary data, which is helpful when handing images. For the most part,
        <code>PrintStream</code> and <code>PrintWriter</code> have identical interfaces, so you can easily interchange
        them.)
    </li>
    <li>Browse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Response_fields">this document</a> for a
        list of response header fields that you may want to implement.
    </li>
    <li>Use <a href="html">these files</a> as a starting point for testing your server.</li>
</ul>

<p class="listHeader">Steps in completing project:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Complete the <a href="beginWebServer.html">in-class assignment</a>:
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Create a Server socket, accept a connection, set up the input and output.</li>
            <li>Read the "GET" line from the client.</li>
            <li>Use a loop to read all the request headers. Print them to the standard output.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Parse the "GET" line (e.g., using <code>String.split</code>.)</li>
    <li>Open the requested file.</li>
    <li>Print the required response headers (<code>Content-type</code> and <code>Content-length</code>) (You may base
        the content-type on the file
        extension.)
    </li>
    <li>Use a loop to
        <ul>
            <li>Read a block of data from the file then</li>
            <li>Write the data to the socket</li>
        </ul>
        For a text file, you can read and write one line at a time. For a data file (like an image), you will want to
        use the raw <code>read</code> method to read a block of data (typically a few Kilobytes), then use the
        corresponding <code>write</code> method to write it to the socket. The <code>read</code> method typically
        returns the amount of data read, which may be less than your buffer size. You can write a text file this way
        also (which means you don't need separate code to handle text and data).
    </li>
    <li>Finally, close the socket.</li>
</ol>


<p class="listHeader">To test your server</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a folder named "<code>data</code>" in your project,</li>
    <li>Put some test files in this folder (e.g., a few <code>.html</code> files, a few <code>.txt</code> files and a
        few images),
    </li>
    <li>Launch your server on some port (e.g., 8080) from your project directory (i.e., the one that contains
        <code>data</code>)
    </li>
    <li>Point your web browser to "<code>localhost:8080/data/file1.html</code>"</li>
</ul>


<h2>Security</h2>


<p class="listHeader">This program allows clients access to files on your computer. This is a potential security risk.
    Here are some ways
    to protect yourself:
<ul>
    <li>Only run the program for a few minutes at a time. (Don't leave it running unless you are testing it.)</li>
    <li>Choose a different port number each time you run it.</li>
    <li>Only serve files that are below the directory from which the server is launched. Ignore requests for other
        files.
    </li>
    <li>Only accept connections from trusted clients. For example, you can choose to accept connections only from
        yourself:
        <code>if (!clientSocket.getInetAddress().isLoopbackAddress()) { return;} </code>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, I can't guarantee that there aren't other Java or Operating System bugs that
    could be exploited. If you still have concerns, run your program on one of the EOS or Arch machines instead.</p>


<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>Before I will grade this assignment, you must present a written testing plan. Automatic tests (JUnit, Cucumber, etc.)
    are optional, but you must have a written plan demonstrating that you have tested all the features of your web
    server. (I expect that most if this written plan will be a list of requests you have a web browser make to your web
    server and the expected response.)</p>

Your score is based on when your server is 100% correct.
<ul>
    <li> Friday before noon: Full credit.</li>
    <li> 2% penalty before class Monday</li>
    <li>5% penalty per day after next Monday.</li>
</ul>

Your code must be well-organized and documented. I will deduct points for uncommented and or "spaghetti" code.

<hr>

<h2>More Sample Code</h2>

<p>In Java, the <code>File</code> object provides access to data about a file.</p>

<pre>
     File file = new File(filename);
      if (!file.exists()) {
        out.println("HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND");
        out.println("");
      }
</pre>

<p>Use a <code>FileInputStream</code> to access the contents of the file:</p>
<pre>
    InputStream fileIn = null;
    try {
       fileIn = new FileInputStream(file); // Can also pass the constructor a String
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        int amount_read = fileIn.read(buffer); // read up to 1024 bytes of raw data
        out.write(buffer, 0, amount_read); // write data back out to an OutputStream

</pre>

<p>You will need to use the "raw" <code>read</code> method to read images.</p>
