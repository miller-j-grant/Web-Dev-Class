Slim is a very lightweight web framework. (Think of it a the smallest
possible version of Laravel, Symphony, or Ruby on Rails.)

FriendsDB is a very simple example that shows how to set up the
routes, views, database, and dependency injection.

Normally, you create a new Slim project by running

composer.phar require slim/slim
composer.phar require slim/php-view

However, composer isn't currently installed on EOS. SlimStart is what
you get when you initialize a project using composer.  Thus, you can
begin a Slim project by copying SlimStart into your own account.
